# Agent Note: plugin-manager updates on an application-owned profile

Status: implemented

## Problem

On the packaged Desktop client (the DeepSeek Harness Electron app, DSH 0.1.7-rc.2
with profile `desktop`), clicking **Update** in this plugin's check-for-updates
block failed with `操作失败：env: node: No such file or directory`.

Live evidence from the running host (pid 72345, argv
`[Electron, --expose-internals, …/dsh-desktop-host/lib/index.js, …/dsh,
/Users/zcl/.dsh/profiles/desktop, …]`):

- `ps eww` shows the host environment as `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
  — a GUI-launched process with no node and no homebrew prefix, although
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` marks it as an Electron-as-Node host.
- `findDshBinary()` falls through PATH (no `dsh`), through the host-entry
  probes (the packaged runtime's `app.asar` carries no `node_modules/.bin`
  directory and no `dsh-desktop-host/lib/bin.js`), and lands on the darwin
  fallback `/opt/homebrew/bin/dsh` — a symlink to
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js` whose first line is `#!/usr/bin/env node`.
- `dshSpawnCommand()` returned that path unchanged off Windows ("bin.js
  carries a node shebang, so POSIX spawns it directly"), so the kernel handed
  the shebang to `/usr/bin/env`, which could not find `node` on the child's
  PATH. Reproduced exactly:
  `env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin /opt/homebrew/bin/dsh --version` → exit 127,
  `env: node: No such file or directory`; the gateway surfaces the CLI's raw
  stderr tail as the job error, which is the string the panel rendered.

Two further facts decide the fix:

- Even with a working spawn, the profile cannot be written by the CLI:
  `dsh plugin --profile desktop …` exits 1 with
  `error: profile "desktop" is managed exclusively by the Electron application`
  (`rejectElectronProfile` in the official `dsh` CLI). The packaged launcher
  hands its bundled runtime to the host as launcher facts
  (`packageManager: { command: process.execPath, args: [--expose-internals,
  <runtime>/pnpm/bin/pnpm.mjs], env: { PATH: <runtime>/bin + delimiter + PATH } }`),
  so an application-owned profile is written in-process, not through the CLI.
- That in-process writer exists and is mounted: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` inserts
  `id: plugin-manager, name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-plugin-manager'`, and its class
  extends `TypertRemoteService`, whose constructor is `super(ctx,
  "pluginManager")` — an ordinary Cordis service under the key
  `pluginManager` with the `installBundle` / `removeBundle` methods the
  official Plugins page drives as `ctx.remote.pluginManager`.

## Decision

1. **A Node-script CLI is never spawned through its shebang.** `isNodeScript()`
   classifies a resolved CLI path as a Node script by extension (`.js`,
   `.cjs`, `.mjs`) or by a `#!… node` shebang probe, and
   `dshSpawnCommand()` then runs it under an interpreter that exists without
   PATH: a `node` installed beside the CLI when the installation ships one
   (npm-global and homebrew layouts), otherwise `process.execPath` — the
   Electron host covered by the existing `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` branch. A
   native executable or a shell wrapper still spawns as-is, and an unreadable
   head falls back to the previous direct spawn.
2. **The CLI's own directory goes first on the child PATH**
   (`withPrependedPath()`, collapsing every case variant of the key into one
   `PATH`, the Windows hazard the desktop childEnv note records). `dsh plugin`
   forwards to pnpm, and npm-global and homebrew installations keep `pnpm`
   beside `dsh`; without this the update would start and then fail on a
   missing pnpm.
3. **An application-owned profile updates through the official in-process
   manager.** `CliGateway` reads `ctx.get('pluginManager')` through a seam the
   host half supplies, and only when `facts.desktop` is true: the official
   manager resolves the registry, runs pnpm with the launcher's bundled
   toolchain and applies the bundle. The job table, `/status` polling, the
   mutation queue and the version verification are unchanged, and the update is
   only `done` after the dependency is still in the profile and reports the
   version the route resolved — a green manager call that moved nothing is a
   `更新未生效` error, exactly like the CLI path. Every other runtime keeps the
   CLI as the single writer, unchanged.
4. **The manager's resolved verdict is read before the profile is.** Its
   `change()` wrapper catches every failure and folds it into the resolved
   value (`application: 'failed'` / `'cancelled'`, plus `error.code` and
   `error.diagnostic`), so a resolved `installBundle` is not proof of success.
   Reading only whether the call threw reported a run pnpm had refused as
   `官方插件管理器报告成功，但 … 仍为 …（更新未生效）` and hid the reason
   (2026-09-29, `dsh-better-sidebar` 0.22.1 → 0.24.1:
   `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION` in the manager's own
   `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/.plugin-manager/logs/operation-YG19PC/pnpm.log`).
   `nativeManagerFailure()` renders that verdict — the pnpm diagnostic, the
   packages an `incompatible-version` refusal names, or the cancellation — and
   only a verdict that is not a failure goes on to the profile re-read.

The official manager is a contract observation, not an import: the repository
builds against the official SDK's published packages, and this package must
keep running on a host that mounts no manager. The route stays behind the
loopback fence and the user's click, the same authority the official Plugins
page has when it calls the same service.

The official manager later stopped accepting an in-place update at all: 0.2.1-rc.2 refuses an already-carried dependency while `hmr` is mounted, so item 3's single `installBundle` call is now only the first phase of an update — see
[the two-phase replacement](2026-10-17-plugin-manager-native-update-two-phase.md).

## Alternatives considered

- **Fix only the spawn and let the CLI report the refusal.** Rejected: the
  update button would then fail with an English upstream message on the very
  runtime the feature is used from, and DSH will not relax the rule — the
  profile belongs to the app.
- **Route every operation through the official manager whenever it is mounted.**
  Rejected for now: installs and removals on the npm web runtime go through the
  CLI path whose reconciliation guards (duplicate entry ids, unresolvable
  insert rows, duplicate-mount stripping, `--dump-config` preflight) this
  gateway exists to provide, and the official manager enforces its own
  equivalents. Moving them is a separate decision with its own evidence.
- **Run pnpm directly from the gateway for app-owned profiles.** Rejected: it
  duplicates the official manager's job — registry planning, lock, bundle
  activation, build-script approval — against the repository rule that native
  DSH stays the base.
- **Reach the official manager from the browser half through
  `ctx.remote.pluginManager`.** Rejected: the host half runs in the same
  process as the service, so the client hop would add a wire face, an
  `/mode` flag and a third client channel for no benefit.
- **Prepend the app's bundled runtime bin to PATH instead of resolving an
  interpreter.** Rejected: the launcher's PATH fact belongs to the app, its
  directory holds only a `node` launcher shim (no pnpm), and this package must
  work for a CLI-booted host as well.

## Consequences

- A check-for-updates update on the packaged Desktop client works: the job
  reports `done` with the new version row, then the panel shows the restart
  hint. The same spawn fix applies to every other CLI call the gateway makes
  (`--version` probes, installs, removals, migrations) on any GUI-launched
  host.
- The gateway's own guards do not run on the native update path; the official
  manager owns registry resolution, pnpm invocation, the profile lock and
  bundle activation there, and this gateway re-reads the profile afterwards
  for verification.
- The change takes effect on the next host start (the host half is a built
  `lib/index.js` loaded at boot).
- Installs and removals on the same profile later took the same native writer,
  which is a separate decision with its own evidence: [the install-path
  note](2026-09-27-plugin-manager-app-owned-install-path.md).

## Testing

- `tests/gateway.spec.ts`: `dshSpawnCommand` picks the sibling `node` for a
  `#!/usr/bin/env node` shim and `process.execPath` when none is installed
  beside it, runs a `.js` bin path through the interpreter without probing the
  file, still spawns a native binary and a `#!/bin/sh` wrapper directly, and
  falls back to a direct spawn when the head cannot be read;
  `withPrependedPath` prepends to a POSIX PATH, collapses Windows case
  variants into one key, and writes PATH when the environment carries none.
- `tests/gateway-jobs.spec.ts`: on a `desktop` fact set the update runs
  through a scripted official manager and the CLI spawn seam throws if it is
  ever used; a manager rejection settles the job as an error with the manager's
  message; a folded failure verdict is reported with its own reason
  (`官方插件管理器更新失败：…`) instead of the `更新未生效` no-op text; a
  cancellation and an `incompatible-version` verdict are named; a green manager
  run that left the version in place is `更新未生效`; a positive verdict still
  goes through the profile re-read; and on a non-desktop profile the CLI stays
  the writer with the manager untouched.
- Live reproduction of the spawn defect and of its repair against the real
  installation: exit 127 with `env: node: No such file or directory` for the
  old shape, `0.1.7-rc.2` for `/opt/homebrew/bin/node /opt/homebrew/bin/dsh
  --version` under the host's own `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`, and
  `error: profile "desktop" is managed exclusively by the Electron application`
  once the CLI starts with its directory on PATH.
- Not verified live in this change: the native update run itself needs the
  restarted packaged host, which the repository forbids an agent to restart.
  The evidence that the service exists there is the mounted `dsh-base` row,
  the `super(ctx, "pluginManager")` binding, and the official Plugins page
  this package's section renders inside, which drives the same service.
