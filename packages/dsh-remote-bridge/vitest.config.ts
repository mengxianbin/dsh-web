 * This package's host suites drive the protocol state machine over a recording
 * carrier and real node crypto, so node is the default environment and no path
 * aliasing is involved. The browser half's component specs opt into jsdom with
 * a per-file `// @vitest-environment jsdom` docblock, so the node suites keep
 * the cheaper environment. The include list keeps the scan on the two source
 * roots and off the emitted lib/ tree.
