/**
 * subagent-routes — the LiangShen preset's authorization guard for delegated
 * child routes.
 *
 * The harness records a Session's authorized child routes as a durable
 * `subagent/model-selection-policy` event, but its own delegation tool only
 * rejects an EXPLICIT route outside that list: a call that names no
 * `provider`/`model` falls back to the configured child defaults or to the
 * parent's own route. A session whose allowlist authorizes only one family
 * would therefore still spawn children on the parent's route simply because
 * nobody named one — or, for `subagent_fork`, because the tool cannot name one
 * at all.
 *
 * This row closes that gap from the preset plane. Whenever the calling Session
 * (or the nearest ancestor that recorded one) carries an allowlist, every
 * delegation the row polices must resolve to an authorized route:
 *
 * - `explicit` tools publish `provider`/`model`; the call must name a complete
 *   pair, and that pair must be on the list;
 * - `inherit` tools publish neither and start the child on the caller's own
 *   route; the guard forbids a route override there and checks the inherited
 *   route against the same list, because "the tool cannot choose" is not the
 *   same as "the choice is authorized".
 *
 * The mode a tool is policed in is configuration, but its PARAMETERS are a
 * runtime fact: a composition written for an older cohort mounts the tool with
 * neither route field, and demanding a pair from it would be a denial no call
 * could satisfy. The guard therefore asks the registry which fields the tool
 * actually declares, and enforces such a tool through the route its child
 * would inherit.
 *
 * The guard is deliberately fail-open on every fact it cannot read (no policy
 * event, no session registry, no registry probe): a delegation the harness can
 * resolve is never blocked by a missing observation, and the row only ever
 * adds a denial it can justify from the durable log.
